## About me

I am a student at the _LSE_ studying < >.

I will use this GitHub profile to showcase my data science skills.

### Interests

- Python 
- Data Science
- Something crazy

## My Work
I first cloned the repository to work with my local machine and use git commands to push it to GitHub. I also did some webscraping from a website and stored in a json file, organised the data in a Dataframe using pandas and stored in csv file, as well as extracted image url of every container in the website.

## My repository structure
There is the jupiter notebook itself to showcase preprocessing Python script as well as its output.
There are data in json file, csv file, and images in each directories.
